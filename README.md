# Website-Traffic-Analysis
This Project contains dashboard showing insights of traffic analysis in a website. The data visualization dashboard is created using Power BI and the source of the data is Google Analytics.

Initially I collected the data of my company's website from google analytics and choose only required fields like Date, City, Country, Continent, Users, New Users, User Type, Device Category, Sessions, Number of Sessions, Session Duration, Bounce Rate.

Then I performed some transformation required in the collected dataset and then loaded it into Power BI Desktop tool.

Created various visualizations for analysis like cards to display total website visitors, new visitors, bounce rate and sessions.

Imported BCI calendar visual from store to display website vistotors by date.

Created an area chart showing graph for total visitors vs new vistors and a bar chart showing monthly sessions.

Created some measures column and assigned them all to a group which I have used to display percentage of users visiting website using different devices.

I have a used a slicer for selecting year which will affect all other visuals in the dashboard. Also I can use each visual as filter too which will gradually affect other visuals.
